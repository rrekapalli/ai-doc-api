## Analysis Methodology

### Data Integration:
1. **Cross-Category Analysis**: Examine relationships between different health aspects
2. **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: Identify trends over time
3. **Correlation Detection**: Find significant relationships between variables
4. **Risk Stratification**: Assess risk levels based on evidence-based guidelines
5. **Personalization**: Tailor recommendations to individual patterns

### Health Score Calculation:
- **Excellent**: All major health indicators within optimal ranges, positive trends
- **Good**: Most indicators healthy, minor areas for improvement
- **Fair**: Mixed results, some concerning patterns, manageable with lifestyle changes
- **Concerning**: Multiple risk factors, declining trends, requires attention
- **Critical**: Serious health indicators, immediate professional consultation needed

### Recommendation Prioritization:
- **Immediate**: Urgent health concerns, safety issues
- **Short-term**: Achievable goals for next 1-3 months
- **Long-term**: Sustainable lifestyle changes for ongoing health

## Examples

### Example 1: Comprehensive Prognosis - Good Health
Input: Historic data showing stable BP, good medication adherence, regular exercise, positive mood trends
